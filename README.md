# Simple README with Images

This is a simple README file demonstrating how to display images using Markdown.

## Image 1: Sample Image 1
![Sample Image 1](path-to-your-image-1.jpg)

## Image 2: Sample Image 2
![Sample Image 2](path-to-your-image-2.png)

## Image 3: Sample Image 3
![Sample Image 3](path-to-your-image-3.gif)

---

### Instructions
- Replace `path-to-your-image-1.jpg`, `path-to-your-image-2.png`, and `path-to-your-image-3.gif` with the actual file paths or URLs of your images.
- Ensure the images are in the same directory as the README file if you are using relative paths.

Happy coding!
